"a mix of UI elements that inherit from [Control] and [Container] nodes.\n"
"[b]User Interface nodes and input[/b]\n"
"Godot propagates input events via viewports. Each [Viewport] is responsible "
"for propagating [InputEvent]s to their child nodes. As the [member SceneTree."
"root] is a [Window], this already happens automatically for all UI elements "
"in your game.\n"
"Input events are propagated through the [SceneTree] from the root node to "
"all child nodes by calling [method Node._input]. For UI elements "
"specifically, it makes more sense to override the virtual method [method "
"_gui_input], which filters out unrelated input events, such as by checking z-"
"order, [member mouse_filter], focus, or if the event was inside of the "
"control's bounding box.\n"
"Call [method accept_event] so no other node receives the event. Once you "
"accept an input, it becomes handled so [method Node._unhandled_input] will "
"not process it.\n"
"Only one [Control] node can be in focus. Only the node in focus will receive "
"events. To get the focus, call [method grab_focus]. [Control] nodes lose "
"focus when another node grabs it, or if you hide the node in focus.\n"
"Sets [member mouse_filter] to [constant MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE] to tell a "
"[Control] node to ignore mouse or touch events. You'll need it if you place "
"an icon on top of a button.\n"
"[Theme] resources change the Control's appearance. If you change the [Theme] "
"on a [Control] node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the "
"theme's parameters, call one of the [code]add_theme_*_override[/code] "
"methods, like [method add_theme_font_override]. You can override the theme "
"with the Inspector.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Theme items are [i]not[/i] [Object] properties. This means you "
"can't access their values using [method Object.get] and [method Object.set]. "
"Instead, use the [code]get_theme_*[/code] and [code]add_theme_*_override[/"
"code] methods provided by this class."

"[Decal]s are used to project a texture onto a [Mesh] in the scene. Use "
"Decals to add detail to a scene without affecting the underlying [Mesh]. "
"They are often used to add weathering to building, add dirt or mud to the "
"ground, or add variety to props. Decals can be moved at any time, making "
"them suitable for things like blob shadows or laser sight dots.\n"
"They are made of an [AABB] and a group of [Texture2D]s specifying [Color], "
"normal, ORM (ambient occlusion, roughness, metallic), and emission. Decals "
"are projected within their [AABB] so altering the orientation of the Decal "
"affects the direction in which they are projected. By default, Decals are "
"projected down (i.e. from positive Y to negative Y).\n"
"The [Texture2D]s associated with the Decal are automatically stored in a "
"texture atlas which is used for drawing the decals so all decals can be "
"drawn at once. Godot uses clustered decals, meaning they are stored in "
"cluster data and drawn when the mesh is drawn, they are not drawn as a post-"
"processing effect after.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Decals cannot affect an underlying material's transparency, "
"regardless of its transparency mode (alpha blend, alpha scissor, alpha hash, "
"opaque pre-pass). This means translucent or transparent areas of a material "
"will remain translucent or transparent even if an opaque decal is applied on "
"them.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Decals are only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering "
"methods, not Compatibility. When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 "
"decals can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more "
"than 8 decals on a single mesh resource will result in decals flickering in "
"and out as the camera moves.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] When using the Mobile rendering method, decals will only "
"correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the decal's "
"AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside "
"its AABB, [member GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin] must be increased on "
"the mesh. Otherwise, the decal may not be visible on the mesh."

"html]command line argument[/url], this forces the reported [code]delta[/"

"regardless of how long it actually took to render the frame. This can be "
"used to record high-quality videos with perfect frame pacing regardless of "

"Godot has 2 built-in [MovieWriter]s:\n"
"- AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio ([code].avi[/"
"code] file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. "
"The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing [member "
"ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality]. The resulting file can "
"be viewed in most video players, but it must be converted to another format "
"for viewing on the web or by Godot with [VideoStreamPlayer]. MJPEG does not "
"support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in "
"size at most.\n"
"- PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio ([code].png[/code] file "
"extension). Lossless compression, large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed "
"to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as [url=https://ffmpeg."
"org/]FFmpeg[/url] after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, "
"even if the root viewport is set to be transparent.\n"
"If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-"
"party software, you can extend the [MovieWriter] class to create your own "
"movie writers. This should typically be done using GDExtension for "
"performance reasons.\n"
"[b]Editor usage:[/b] A default movie file path can be specified in [member "
"ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/movie_file]. Alternatively, for running "
"single scenes, a [code]movie_path[/code] metadata can be added to the root "
"node, specifying the path to a movie file that will be used when recording "
"that scene. Once a path is set, click the video reel icon in the top-right "
"corner of the editor to enable Movie Maker mode, then run any scene as "
"usual. The engine will start recording as soon as the splash screen is "
"finished, and it will only stop recording when the engine quits. Click the "
"video reel icon again to disable Movie Maker mode. Note that toggling Movie "
"Maker mode does not affect project instances that are already running.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] MovieWriter is available for use in both the editor and "
"exported projects, but it is [i]not[/i] designed for use by end users to "
"record videos while playing. Players wishing to record gameplay videos "
"should install tools such as [url=https://obsproject.com/]OBS Studio[/url] "

"This class is responsible for creating and clearing 3D navigation meshes "
"used as [NavigationMesh] resources inside [NavigationRegion3D]. The "
"[NavigationMeshGenerator] has very limited to no use for 2D as the "
"navigation mesh baking process expects 3D node types and 3D source geometry "
"to parse.\n"
"The entire navigation mesh baking is best done in a separate thread as the "
"voxelization, collision tests and mesh optimization steps involved are very "
"performance and time hungry operations.\n"
"Navigation mesh baking happens in multiple steps and the result depends on "
"3D source geometry and properties of the [NavigationMesh] resource. In the "
"first step, starting from a root node and depending on [NavigationMesh] "
"properties all valid 3D source geometry nodes are collected from the "
"[SceneTree]. Second, all collected nodes are parsed for their relevant 3D "
"geometry data and a combined 3D mesh is build. Due to the many different "
"types of parsable objects, from normal [MeshInstance3D]s to [CSGShape3D]s or "
"various [CollisionObject3D]s, some operations to collect geometry data can "
"trigger [RenderingServer] and [PhysicsServer3D] synchronizations. Server "
"synchronization can have a negative effect on baking time or framerate as it "
"often involves [Mutex] locking for thread security. Many parsable objects "
"and the continuous synchronization with other threaded Servers can increase "
"the baking time significantly. On the other hand only a few but very large "
"and complex objects will take some time to prepare for the Servers which can "
"noticeably stall the next frame render. As a general rule the total number "
"of parsable objects and their individual size and complexity should be "
"balanced to avoid framerate issues or very long baking times. The combined "
"mesh is then passed to the Recast Navigation Object to test the source "
"geometry for walkable terrain suitable to [NavigationMesh] agent properties "
"by creating a voxel world around the meshes bounding area.\n"
"The finalized navigation mesh is then returned and stored inside the "
"[NavigationMesh] for use as a resource inside [NavigationRegion3D] nodes.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Using meshes to not only define walkable surfaces but also "
"obstruct navigation baking does not always work. The navigation baking has "
"no concept of what is a geometry \"inside\" when dealing with mesh source "
"geometry and this is intentional. Depending on current baking parameters, as "

"NavigationServer3D is the server responsible for all 3D navigation. It "

"For two regions to be connected to each other, they must share a similar "
"edge. An edge is considered connected to another if both of its two vertices "

"[b]Note:[/b] The collision avoidance system ignores regions. Using the "
"modified velocity as-is might lead to pushing and agent outside of a "
"navigable area. This is a limitation of the collision avoidance system, any "

"Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of "
"another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any "
"number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct "
"children of a node) should have unique names.\n"
"A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk "
"and then instantiated into other scenes. This allows for very high "
"flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.\n"
"[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a "
"node is added to the scene tree, it receives the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback "
"is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i."
"e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered "
"before its child's.\n"
"Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_READY] notification and their respective [method _ready] "
"callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback "
"is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the "
"parent nodes.\n"
"This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order "
"will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method "
"_enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally "
"[method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).\n"
"[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the \"process\" state, so that they "
"receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). "
"Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method "
"set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame "
"rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] (in seconds) is passed as an "
"argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled "
"with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per "
"second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics "
"engine.\n"
"Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] "
"function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many "
"cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the "
"[method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the "
"input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), "
"ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.\n"
"To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into "
"other scenes), an \"owner\" can be set for the node with the [member owner] "
"property. This keeps track of who instantiated what. This is mostly useful "
"when writing editors and tools, though.\n"
"Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method "
"queue_free], it will also free all its children.\n"
"[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy "
"to manage, you could create groups like \"enemies\" or \"collectables\" for "
"example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method "
"is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes "
"in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the "
"methods on [SceneTree].\n"
"[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, "
"see [ENetMultiplayerPeer]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote "
"procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling [method "
"rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected "
"peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify "
"which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] (make sure "
"node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the high-level "
"networking tutorial and corresponding demos.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] The [code]script[/code] property is part of the [Object] class, "
"not [Node]. It isn't exposed like most properties but does have a setter and "
"getter ([code]set_script()[/code] and [code]get_script()[/code])."

"An advanced [Variant] type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. "
"Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are "
"available to all inheriting classes. For example, a [Sprite2D] instance is "
"able to call [method Node.add_child] because it inherits from [Node].\n"
"You can create new instances, using [code]Object.new()[/code] in GDScript, "
"or [code]new Object[/code] in C#.\n"
"To delete an Object instance, call [method free]. This is necessary for most "
"classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, "
"and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few "
"classes that perform memory management. For example, [RefCounted] (and by "
"extension [Resource]) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and [Node] "
"deletes its children when freed.\n"
"Objects can have a [Script] attached to them. Once the [Script] is "
"instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, "
"allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals.\n"
"Inside a [Script], [method _get_property_list] may be overridden to "
"customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to "
"the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on "
"disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, "
"such as with the [annotation @GDScript.@export] annotation.\n"
"Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, "
"methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can "
"be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not "
"exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as [method set], [method "
"get], [method call], [method has_method], [method has_signal], etc. Note "
"that these methods are [b]much[/b] slower than direct references.\n"
"In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name "
"exists in an object with the [code]in[/code] operator:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var node = Node.new()\n"
"print(\"name\" in node)         # Prints true\n"
"print(\"get_parent\" in node)   # Prints true\n"
"print(\"tree_entered\" in node) # Prints true\n"
"print(\"unknown\" in node)      # Prints false\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Notifications are [int] constants commonly sent and received by objects. For "
"example, on every rendered frame, the [SceneTree] notifies nodes inside the "
"tree with a [constant Node.NOTIFICATION_PROCESS]. The nodes receive it and "
"may call [method Node._process] to update. To make use of notifications, see "
"[method notification] and [method _notification].\n"
"Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). [method "
"set_meta] can be useful to store information that the object itself does not "
"depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is "
"discouraged.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Unlike references to a [RefCounted], references to an object "
"stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to [code]null[/"
"code]. To check if an object has been deleted, do [i]not[/i] compare it "
"against [code]null[/code]. Instead, use [method @GlobalScope."
"is_instance_valid]. It's also recommended to inherit from [RefCounted] for "
"classes storing data instead of [Object].\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] The [code]script[/code] is not exposed like most properties. To "
"set or get an object's [Script] in code, use [method set_script] and [method "
"get_script], respectively."

"- A [i]body[/i] is a physical object which can be in static, kinematic, or "

"Tweens are mostly useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be "
"interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-"
"betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] "
"and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them. Animating "
"something with a [Tween] is called tweening.\n"
"[Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't "
"know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-"
"chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween]; it would be difficult "
"to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node. Tweens are also more "
"light-weight than [AnimationPlayer], so they are very much suited for simple "
"animations or general tasks that don't require visual tweaking provided by "
"the editor. They can be used in a fire-and-forget manner for some logic that "
"normally would be done by code. You can e.g. make something shoot "
"periodically by using a looped [CallbackTweener] with a delay.\n"
"A [Tween] can be created by using either [method SceneTree.create_tween] or "
"[method Node.create_tween]. [Tween]s created manually (i.e. by using "
"[code]Tween.new()[/code]) are invalid and can't be used for tweening "
"values.\n"
"A tween animation is created by adding [Tweener]s to the [Tween] object, "
"using [method tween_property], [method tween_interval], [method "
"tween_callback] or [method tween_method]:\n"
"[codeblocks]\n"
"[gdscript]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween()\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.RED, 1)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"scale\", Vector2(), 1)\n"
"tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)\n"
"[/gdscript]\n"
"[csharp]\n"
"Tween tween = GetTree().CreateTween();\n"

"tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode(\"Sprite\").QueueFree));\n"
"[/csharp]\n"
"[/codeblocks]\n"
"This sequence will make the [code]$Sprite[/code] node turn red, then shrink, "
"before finally calling [method Node.queue_free] to free the sprite. "
"[Tweener]s are executed one after another by default. This behavior can be "
"changed using [method parallel] and [method set_parallel].\n"
"When a [Tweener] is created with one of the [code]tween_*[/code] methods, a "
"chained method call can be used to tweak the properties of this [Tweener]. "
"For example, if you want to set a different transition type in the above "
"example, you can use [method set_trans]:\n"
"[codeblocks]\n"
"[gdscript]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween()\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.RED, 1).set_trans(Tween."

"tween.TweenProperty(GetNode(\"Sprite\"), \"scale\", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f)."
"SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Bounce);\n"
"tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode(\"Sprite\").QueueFree));\n"
"[/csharp]\n"
"[/codeblocks]\n"
"Most of the [Tween] methods can be chained this way too. In the following "
"example the [Tween] is bound to the running script's node and a default "
"transition is set for its [Tweener]s:\n"
"[codeblocks]\n"
"[gdscript]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween().bind_node(self).set_trans(Tween."
"TRANS_ELASTIC)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.RED, 1)\n"

"tween.TweenProperty(GetNode(\"Sprite\"), \"scale\", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);\n"
"tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode(\"Sprite\").QueueFree));\n"
"[/csharp]\n"
"[/codeblocks]\n"
"Another interesting use for [Tween]s is animating arbitrary sets of "
"objects:\n"
"[codeblocks]\n"
"[gdscript]\n"
"var tween = create_tween()\n"
"for sprite in get_children():\n"
"    tween.tween_property(sprite, \"position\", Vector2(0, 0), 1)\n"
"[/gdscript]\n"
"[csharp]\n"
"Tween tween = CreateTween();\n"
"foreach (Node sprite in GetChildren())\n"
"    tween.TweenProperty(sprite, \"position\", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);\n"
"[/csharp]\n"
"[/codeblocks]\n"
"In the example above, all children of a node are moved one after another to "
"position (0, 0).\n"
"You should avoid using more than one [Tween] per object's property. If two "
"or more tweens animate one property at the same time, the last one created "
"will take priority and assign the final value. If you want to interrupt and "
"restart an animation, consider assigning the [Tween] to a variable:\n"
"[codeblocks]\n"
"[gdscript]\n"
"var tween\n"
"func animate():\n"
"    if tween:\n"
"        tween.kill() # Abort the previous animation.\n"

"    _tween = CreateTween();\n"
"}\n"
"[/csharp]\n"
"[/codeblocks]\n"
"Some [Tweener]s use transitions and eases. The first accepts a [enum "
"TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation "
"is handled (see [url=https://easings.net/]easings.net[/url] for some "
"examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls "
"where the [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the "

"[b]Terminology:[/b] In the context of UPnP networking, \"gateway\" (or "
"\"internet gateway device\", short IGD) refers to network devices that allow "
"computers in the local network to access the internet (\"wide area "
"network\", WAN). These gateways are often also called \"routers\".\n"
"[b]Pitfalls:[/b]\n"
"- As explained above, these calls are blocking and shouldn't be run on the "
"main thread, especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time. "
"Use threading!\n"
"- Networking is physical and messy. Packets get lost in transit or get "
"filtered, addresses, free ports and assigned mappings change, and devices "
"may leave or join the network at any time. Be mindful of this, be diligent "
"when checking and handling errors, and handle these gracefully if you can: "
"add clear error UI, timeouts and re-try handling.\n"
"- Port mappings may change (and be removed) at any time, and the remote/"
"external IP address of the gateway can change likewise. You should consider "
"re-querying the external IP and try to update/refresh the port mapping "
"periodically (for example, every 5 minutes and on networking failures).\n"
"- Not all devices support UPnP, and some users disable UPnP support. You "
"need to handle this (e.g. documenting and requiring the user to manually "
"forward ports, or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal, like a relay/"
"mirror server, or NAT hole punching, STUN/TURN, etc.).\n"
"- Consider what happens on mapping conflicts. Maybe multiple users on the "
"same network would like to play your game at the same time, or maybe another "
"application uses the same port. Make the port configurable, and optimally "
"choose a port automatically (re-trying with a different port on failure).\n"

"- Can be used to convert safely between datatypes.\n"
"- Can be used to abstract calling methods and their arguments. Godot exports "

"- Can be used to defer calls or move data between threads.\n"
"- Can be serialized as binary and stored to disk, or transferred via "

"[VoxelGI]s are used to provide high-quality real-time indirect light and "
"reflections to scenes. They precompute the effect of objects that emit light "
"and the effect of static geometry to simulate the behavior of complex light "
"in real-time. [VoxelGI]s need to be baked before having a visible effect. "
"However, once baked, dynamic objects will receive light from them. "
"Furthermore, lights can be fully dynamic or baked.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] [VoxelGI] is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, "
"not Mobile or Compatibility.\n"
"[b]Procedural generation:[/b] [VoxelGI] can be baked in an exported project, "
"which makes it suitable for procedurally generated or user-built levels as "
"long as all the geometry is generated in advance. For games where geometry "
"is generated at any time during gameplay, SDFGI is more suitable (see "
"[member Environment.sdfgi_enabled]).\n"
"[b]Performance:[/b] [VoxelGI] is relatively demanding on the GPU and is not "
"suited to low-end hardware such as integrated graphics (consider "
"[LightmapGI] instead). To improve performance, adjust [member "
"ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/voxel_gi/quality] and enable "
"[member ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/gi/"
"use_half_resolution] in the Project Settings. To provide a fallback for low-"
"end hardware, consider adding an option to disable [VoxelGI] in your "
"project's options menus. A [VoxelGI] node can be disabled by hiding it.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Meshes should have sufficiently thick walls to avoid light "
"leaks (avoid one-sided walls). For interior levels, enclose your level "
"geometry in a sufficiently large box and bridge the loops to close the mesh. "
"To further prevent light leaks, you can also strategically place temporary "
"[MeshInstance3D] nodes with their [member GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode] set to "
"[constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_STATIC]. These temporary nodes can then "
